# About the code

This is my first project created using Javascript. As I had no prior experience, the code is very Object-Oriented styled

## CORS Issue

To make REST Api calls from a static web page (since this is hosted on Github Pages), we need to use a proxy that adds the CORS headers to the request. To do that, I'm using [Rob-W's Cors-Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/) proxy server hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
